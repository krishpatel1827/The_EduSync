B. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS
==========================

1. MODEL-VIEW-TEMPLATE (MVT) PATTERN:
=====================================
Django's implementation of MVC architecture:
- Models: Data layer (models.py files)
- Views: Business logic (views.py files) 
- Templates: Presentation layer (HTML templates)

2. APP-BASED MODULARIZATION:
============================
Each functional area is separated into Django apps:
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Independent development
- Clear responsibility boundaries

3. API-FIRST APPROACH:
======================
Separate API views and web views:
- RESTful API endpoints for mobile/external integration
- Traditional web views for browser interface
- Shared models and business logic
- Consistent data serialization

4. TEMPLATE INHERITANCE:
========================
Hierarchical template structure:
- base.html: Global layout and navigation
- App-specific base templates
- Page-specific templates extending base templates
- Reusable template components

C. SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
=========================

1. AUTHENTICATION LAYERS:
=========================
- Django's built-in User authentication
- Institution-level access control
- Role-based permissions (Admin/Teacher/Student)
- JWT tokens for API access

2. DATA ISOLATION:
==================
- Institution-based data filtering
- Foreign key relationships ensure data boundaries
- QuerySet filtering in views prevents cross-institution access

3. CSRF & XSS PROTECTION:
=========================
- Django's built-in CSRF middleware
- Template auto-escaping
- Secure cookie settings for production

4. SQL INJECTION PREVENTION:
============================
- Django ORM prevents SQL injection
- QuerySet parameterization
- Input validation through forms and serializers

- HTTP methods for operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Stateless authentication using JWT tokens
- JSON data format for requests and responses
- Consistent error handling and status codes

================================================================================
10. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
================================================================================

A. CODE ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES
===============================

1. Django App Structure:
   - Each functional area is a separate Django app
   - Models define data structure
   - Views handle business logic
   - Templates provide user interface
   - URLs route requests to appropriate views

2. Separation of Concerns:
   - Authentication logic in accounts app
   - Academic management in academics app
   - Timetable generation in generator app
   - Institution management in institution app

3. API Development:
   - Separate API views from web views
   - Consistent serialization patterns
   - RESTful endpoint design
   - Comprehensive error handling

B. DATABASE DEVELOPMENT
=======================

Model Development Process:
1. Design entity relationships
2. Create Django models with appropriate field types
3. Define foreign key relationships and constraints
4. Add model methods for business logic
5. Create and run migrations
6. Test model functionality

Migration Management:
- Use descriptive migration names
- Test migrations on sample data
- Keep migrations atomic and reversible
- Document breaking changes

C. FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
=======================

Template Development:
- Use template inheritance for consistent layout
- Implement responsive design with Bootstrap
- Add interactive JavaScript functionality
- Ensure accessibility compliance

Static Asset Management:
- Organize CSS by component/page
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement caching strategies

D. TESTING STRATEGY
===================

Unit Testing:
- Test model methods and properties
- Test view logic and permissions
- Test API endpoints and serializers
- Test form validation and processing

Integration Testing:
- Test complete user workflows
- Test database transactions
- Test authentication flows
- Test API integration

E. VERSION CONTROL
==================

Git Workflow:
- Feature branches for new development
- Descriptive commit messages
- Code review process
- Merge to main branch after testing

Branch Strategy:
- main: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/*: Individual feature development
- hotfix/*: Critical bug fixes
